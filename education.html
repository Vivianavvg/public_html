	<p>I gruaated highschool at Tri cities in 2020, but I actually dont have any pictures since I did not go to my graduation. Since it was the peak of the pandemic, the ceremony was at our parking lot as we picked up our diploma and took a picture with the principle... I did not seem it was cool to celebrate like that... I just played video games during that day</p>
